# RBE2001_Final_Code
Final demonstration code for RBE2001: Unified Robotics I course at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Using a Pololu 32U4 control board with the Romi chassis kit.

Also using the wpi-32u4-library.

Here is a [link to a slide deck showing off the robot.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RSNxXwS2nH1dzMwQobcXbs9UcIWBT2nnkz8uRq31fc8/edit?usp=sharing)

Update 10/21/20: This course is now completed so there will be no further updates to this code. This is a mix of "clean" code then *quick and dirty* code that was needed to get the robot running in a short period of time. Please don't judge me :)
